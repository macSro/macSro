<h1>About me</h1>

A chatterbox since a kid, I find it easy to connect with others, which helps with collaboration at work. I consider myself highly organized, however also quite spontaneous and flexible. I am a fast-learner, although I know when to reach out for help. Thanks to those traits I found success in project management as part of Students' Union of Wroclaw University of Science and Technology (WUST).

Here are some of the events I organized / co-organized:
* Student fan zone during the FIFA World Cup in 2018 âš½
* Explosion of Colors as part of the Juwenalia of WUST ðŸ’¥
* Polliwood Welcome Party of WUST ðŸŽ‰
* 2x Official Christmas "Movie" of WUST ðŸŽ¥

Having finished studies, I am eager to kick-start my career in mobile development. Despite my preference for working remotely, I still genuinely appreciate spending time with my coworkers (_partly influenced by my love for the show The Office_ ðŸ‘”).

<h1>Hobbies</h1>

Being a very social person, I prefer to spend most of my free time with friends and family. Thus, most of my hobbies reflect that. And when I need space, I put on my headphones to listen to music as a way to meditate. Below, you can find my TOP 3 favorite leisure activities.

<h2>Cooking</h2>

I've been showing signs of passion for cooking since I was a little kid. Not only would I happily help my parents in the kitchen _(not without sneaking a taste...)_, but I would also try to create new dishes myself! Here's a picture of my first recipe ðŸ¥—


<div align="center">

</div>

<h4>Vegetable salad</h4>

Lettuce, grated cucumber, radish, 3 cloves of garlic (grated), a little pickle juice, salt, sugar, pepper, lemon juice, marjoram, cheese, sausage.

_Cheese and sausage, really???_ ðŸ¤¨

<h2>Gaming</h2>

While I've definitely spent way too much time gaming online (mostly FPS, e.g. CS:GO and Valorant), I honestly prefer meeting with friends to play some board games. I'd say my favorite genre is strategy, which probably roots back to my childhood favorite video game: _Heroes of Might and Magic V_.

<h2>Traveling</h2>

Ever since I was a kid, I had this amazing opportunity to travel across the world. Of course, back then I only wanted to relax in the sun rather than wake up early to sightsee (my parents definitely did not agree nor let me ðŸ«£). Looking back, I appreciate that deeply because now when I'm able to travel on my own, I value getting to know new cultures much more.

Below are the list of countries that I'd love to travel to and the list of countries that I've already "checked off".
